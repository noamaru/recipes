    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In Japanese, tamago means egg, and yaki means grill, so tamagoyaki translates to “grilled egg.” To make this
        classic dish, we roll up layers of thin egg crepe in a frying pan, wrap it into a log shape, and slice it into
        bite-sized pieces that you can pick up with chopsticks.

        Unlike the typical Western omelette, Japanese tamagoyaki uses an egg mixture flavored with dashi, soy sauce,
        mirin, and sugar. This seasoning gives it a lightly sweet and savory taste.</p>
