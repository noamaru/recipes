    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Yakisoba (焼きそば) is a stir-fried noodle dish that typically includes meat or seafood, as well as vegetables such
        as cabbage, carrots, onions, and bean sprouts. These ingredients are all cooked together in a thick,
        sweet-savory sauce, and the final dish is usually topped with aonori (dried green seaweed) and red pickled
        ginger for added flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Yakisoba noodles: These are Chinese-style noodles made with wheat flour</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Vegetables: I use thinly sliced yellow onion, green onion, julienned carrot, some sliced shiitake
                mushrooms,
                and chopped cabbage. These veggies work great for a stir-fry. You can also use bok choy or thin strips
                of
                bell pepper.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Protein(s): I use sliced pork belly in this recipe as it is the most common choice of meat to make
                yakisoba
                in Japan. However, you can switch it up with any protein like shrimp, calamari, chicken, and firm tofu.
        </li>
        <li>Oil: Any neutral-tasting oil will work.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Yakisoba Sauce: Worcestershire sauce, oyster sauce (or vegetarian stir fry sauce), ketchup, soy sauce,
                and
                sugar. Adjust the amount to suit your taste.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Optional toppings: aonori (powdered green seaweed) and beni shoga (red pickled ginger). Some people also
                like to top the noodles with katsuobushi (shaved bonito flakes).
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
