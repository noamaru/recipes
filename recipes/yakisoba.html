    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Yakisoba (焼きそば) is a stir-fried noodle dish that typically includes meat or seafood, as well as vegetables such
        as cabbage, carrots, onions, and bean sprouts. These ingredients are all cooked together in a thick,
        sweet-savory sauce, and the final dish is usually topped with aonori (dried green seaweed) and red pickled
        ginger for added flavor.</p>
