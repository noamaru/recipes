    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Yakitori refers to Japanese-style grilled chicken skewers enjoyed in specialty restaurants and Japanese
        gastropubs called izakaya. Translating to “grilled” (yaki) + “chicken” (tori), versions of this dish have been a
        staple of Japanese cuisine for centuries. In countless yakitori restaurants around Tokyo, notably in Shinjuku’s
        Yakitori Alley, it’s typically cooked over a hot Japanese binchotan charcoal grill. It’s easily adaptable to
        other cooking methods so you can make it at home, too.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Mirin</li>
        <li>Sake</li>
        <li>Brown sugar</li>
        <li>Tokyo negi</li>
        <li>boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Shichimi Torigashi</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Prepare the scallions and make the sauce. Slice the base of the scallions into bite-sized pieces (1¼
                inches or 3 cm). Cut the green parts in half crosswise. Add the green parts and the sauce ingredients to
                a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Then, reduce to a simmer until the sauce thickens, about 30
                minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Assemble the skewers. Cut the chicken thighs into 1¼-inch (3-cm) squares. Skewer the pieces of chicken
                and green onion, and repeat. Continue until you use all the skewers. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Prepare the cooking equipment. Preheat the broiler, line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and place a
                wire rack on top. Grease the rack with oil and place the skewers on it. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Broil and serve. Broil the skewers for 6 minutes, brush with sauce on both sides, and broil for another
                3–4 minutes. Flip once more, brush with more sauce, and broil for 1–2 minutes. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Serve. Serve immediately with additional sauce and shichimi togarashi, if desired.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
