    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Yakitori refers to Japanese-style grilled chicken skewers enjoyed in specialty restaurants and Japanese
        gastropubs called izakaya. Translating to “grilled” (yaki) + “chicken” (tori), versions of this dish have been a
        staple of Japanese cuisine for centuries. In countless yakitori restaurants around Tokyo, notably in Shinjuku’s
        Yakitori Alley, it’s typically cooked over a hot Japanese binchotan charcoal grill. It’s easily adaptable to
        other cooking methods so you can make it at home, too.</p>
